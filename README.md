# KetamineGS
This is an attempt at making a Gameserver for Mr. Krabs Overdoses on Ketamine.<br>

How to Start the Server:
just type in `open ALS_DemoLevel?listen` and the server will start listening.<br><br>

Known Issues:<br>
- Client has little replication (besides the basics like Pawn, PlayerController, PlayerState, but no CheatManager)<br>
- Camera isn't attached to Pawn *Trying Client DLL tomorrow to fix it*<br>
- No HUD (should be a easy fix)<br><br>

**This is not ready for production. Please do not use this to publicly host, also please ask me before using my code**<br>

There is no SDK included so you will have to dump one yourself (use Dumper-7)<br>
